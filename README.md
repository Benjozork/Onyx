# Onyx
A small (or big ?) project of mine

The game is set to be a 2D shoot-em-up game with nice graphical effects (I have thought to create a small scripting language to achieve this) and a lot of fast-paced EDM in the background :p

* **Language**: Java
* **Engine**: LibGDX
* **APIs** (GUI: Custom (might release separately in the future), Physics: Box2D (planned), Level/Map: Custom (planned))
* **Platform**: Currently only supports Desktop JVM, but LibGDX supports Android/iOS/HTML5 so why not ?
