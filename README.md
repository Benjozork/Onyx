# Onyx
A small (or big ?) project of mine
* **Language**: Java
* **Engine**: LibGDX
* **APIs** (GUI: Custom (might release separately in the future), Physics: Box2D (planned), Level/Map: Custom (planned))
* **Platform**: Currently only supports Desktop JVM, but LibGDX supports Android/iOS/HTML5 so why not ?
